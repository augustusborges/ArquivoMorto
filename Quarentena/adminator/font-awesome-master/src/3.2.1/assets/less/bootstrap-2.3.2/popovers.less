Parallax Engine that reacts to the orientation of a smart device. Where no gyroscope or motion detection hardware is available, the position of the cursor is used instead.

Check out the **[demo](http://wagerfield.github.com/parallax/)** to see it in action!

# 1. Getting started

## 1.1 Installation

### 1.1 a) Using the CDN

1. Add `<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/parallax/3.1.0/parallax.min.js"></script>` to your markup
2. Done!

Many thanks to the fine folks over at [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/) for hosting our library.

### 1.1 b) Beginners

1. Head over to the [releases](https://github.com/wagerfield/parallax/releases) Section
2. Download `compiled.zip` from the latest release
3. Extract the ZIP archive and locate the `parallax.js` and `parallax.min.js` files
	- Use `parallax.js` if you want to snoop around in the code
	- Use `parallax.min.js` for deployment, because it has a smaller file size
4. Copy the file of your choice into your project directory
5. So far, so good!

### 1.1 c) Professionals

`npm i -s parallax-js`

You will then find the source code in `node_modules/parallax-js/src/parallax.js` and the browserified, babelified, uglified, production-ready version in `node_modules/parallax-js/dist/parallax.min.js`

## 1.2 Preparations

### Include the Script

If you use the compiled version, either downloaded from the releases page, or copied from the `dist` folder, include the script like any other Javascript library:  
`<script src="path/to/parallax.js"></script>`

Of course, when you've installed via npm, and use browserify/babel, you can also simply do:  
`import Parallax from 'parallax-js'` or  
`const Parallax = require('parallax-js')`

### Create your HTML elements

Each Parallax.js instance needs a container element, the scene. You're free to identify it by any means you want, but for now, let's use an ID:

```html
<div id="scene">
</div>
```

Per default, all direct child elements of the scene will become moving objects, the layers. You can change this to a custom query selector, but again, we're going with the easiest approach for now:

```html
<div id="scene">
  <div>My first Layer!</div>
  <div>My second Layer!</div>
</div>
```

While all other options and parameters are optional, with sane defaul
